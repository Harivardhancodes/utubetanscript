meaningful decisions now if you're a junior you will probably say ah what a waste of time let's get into figma right now that's totally normal when you're studying out but let me be super upfront with you that thinking will keep you stuck in the cookie cutter type of websites so the bottom line is that content comes first remember we're not in the Cosmetic business we're designers every visual element you introduce should have a meaning no space for looks cool or it's trendy ask yourself why am I using this element if it's because it's trendy or or because it's cool then you should fix it you should either remove it or you should give a meaning to it let me share an example with you so this design right you hover it breaks the typography you see the trailer and then you close it and come back to the hero right how did I come up with that design well the idea came from the content so the thought process was I have this design right how can I give meaning to this so that it's not like a cookie cutter type of design granted there's an edge to the layout right there it's not the typical layout but that's not enough to make something that is tailor made for a client so the idea of the the typography cut out like this came from this is a boxing Series right and so I imagined like what would happen if I would punch the title in the middle well probably if it's like for example a glass it would break from The Middle and expand like this right and so I thought okay let's do that with the hover state of the main Watch trailer CTA and that's where the idea came from so let content guide your decisions instead of Trends you will be way ahead of the Curve number two don't be mild there's an 80 chance that you're being too mild with your decisions be bold or be super subtle but avoid mild decisions avoid gray areas in general my gut would be to tell you just do Bolder decisions to contrast two type hierarchies go extreme don't just do like maybe even double like even double would be like a mild decision just go extreme so this title for example right I didn't just grab the size of the paragraph for example and say okay let's multiply it by two or by three or I don't know let's do like the maximum here on on the scale right 128. no I just went like super extreme I said what happens if this title feels almost all the hero right and so I went super extreme because that's the name of the series and I didn't do just like a mild decision so this is what I mean with super extreme intentful decisions now on the other hand you could also do subtle decisions so for example in this website there's little details on White and the background is like an off-white so the details that are white are very hardly noticeable they are very subtle if you scroll down the page you will see more of them the idea is I don't want this details to be overbearing on the layout I just want them to be extremely on the background so very very subtle so that's what I mean like go really subtle or go really bold avoid this Middle Ground okay number three create depth one of the seven laws of good web design is that it's natural so this means that it mimics real life and in real life there's hierarchy by depth now there's things in the foreground that are the ones that we pay attention to right in this Frame I am in the foreground right and you're paying attention to me and there's things in the background that we don't pay attention that much attention to like the things here right little books the sleeves the lamp the couch right things in the background you're not paying attention to them but they are there and they create this depth now in your designs Mark three distinct levels of hierarchy what's primary looks closer what secondary looks further away and what's tertiary looks far away okay so let me show you again an example and by the way shout out to off type for providing me with this beautiful Rhapsody typeface for me and for the bone club members so thank you in this example right there's something on the foreground which is the title right man trackers that's what you're paying attention to now secondary to that there's an image and the image is very related to the content right we want users to connect the title with the image and those two things are going to be the immediate scan that the users are going to make to understand what are they looking at and tertiary are for example the CTA right that's tertiary and then things like paragraphs nav items and stuff like that are very on the background right so Mark at least three distinct hierarchies like this number four reference more input determines output one major activity art directors engage in every day that Juniors don't is looking and saving references for example on Pinterest on dribble on big hands wherever I used to look at references 30 minutes a day at least for years and I still do that okay so the idea with this is that you need to expand your visual catalog when you're starting out because you're gonna mostly most likely be exposed to cookie cutter websites right so you need to expand your visual catalog and to do that you need to look for references okay Paul Rand said don't try to be original just try to be good so reference more right don't be afraid to copy things not just still right exactly the same designs or design ideas right and don't you know replicate them if you're replicating them just do them for an exercise and it's by the way a great exercise but um take take ideas from you know several designs at the same time right so that combined you're doing something different and nobody knows like oh this is exactly like this other design right I committed that error and you know I can tell you there's gonna be police designers out there saying oh uh isn't this the same of so just don't don't be too obvious right but at the same time don't be afraid to reference others because we learn by referencing others so let me show you my Pinterest right so for example if you take a look at the public boards you will see that for example web design I have 1 600 pins right this is a combination of things that have been pinning along ears there's also a graphic design board there's also a typography board that you can check out if you want right but create your own board and start filling it with ideas okay number five show me don't tell me so an image is worth more than a thousand words we've heard this a thousand times now that's why users don't read a website they scan it okay so don't leave long paragraphs of text without any images icons or visual Clues to support them okay websites should be infographic and full of visualizations of the information at the very least if you have a lot of information try to break it up into different hierarchies so let me show you for example right the bond website granted you know the testimonials I cannot do anything about it but for example I could have just put here right the double the the online course includes this this and this right there's five stages blah blah blah but I included this graphic because bond is all about Bridging the Gap That's My slogan and so for example on disk and bond means Bridge so here I created like an interaction right why not create an interaction where I'm taking you from stage to stage with a car right that's moving as you scroll and I'm fading in the titles of the stages in a progression as you can see right so this is an a very easy way that you can just use meaning right and try to visualize the information not just tell me what it is about but just show me with Graphics okay number six use typologies of information so a brief is usually a very long boring document with lots of text number six use typologies of information so a brief is usually a boring long document with lost lots of text this is the raw data as designers our job is to digest the data and turn it into information different typologies of information can give you excuses to visualize elements and create different hierarchies so let me show you an example in this website right I got a very long document with full of text right and what I did is I broke it up into titles I broke it up into for example little stats like this with little badges I created some um you know like a molecule here with a stat and a sub subtitle or a label right to title this stat right and so for example I used I used it throughout here again right title stats with different hierarchies as well highlighted quotes Etc so try to visualize and give hierarchy to your content and pair it also with images right like this like you see on this website just to make sure that you're supporting the message and creating information not just spitting out data on your websites number seven iterate don't marry to your first attempt this is so common when you're starting out right but what I want you to do is duplicate your artboard and be make big changes so let me again show you another example so here right I started with this layout very basic very symmetric boring and then I started iterating right I created different dispositions of the same elements then here I changed the typeface and here I started refining and iterating on that particular layer and doing micro changes and this was the hero that I selected okay now it does take one attempt to come to this conclusions right takes several attempts so duplicate it so that you can also look back and see oh this idea was cool let me go back to this it just gives you more peace of mind to move forward and try Bolder things number eight switch alignment so not every element needs to be stacked vertically and aligned to the same edge mark two or three strong edges in the composition and switch alignments between those edges throughout the page of course the best way to achieve this is by using a grid let me show you what I mean with this on this website instead of just putting everything on one alignment or just doing left right left right what I did is I just created three edges so you can see here I just created three strong edges right with a grid and then what it did is I I repeated the alignments of everything to those edges or mostly everything right you can see that for example here there's an alignment to the first one and the third one and I didn't use the second one here I used again the first one and the third one but then here for example I used the second one here for example I used three and I'm using like different hierarchies like for example this one is pretty big and I'm using it for the second one and I'm not using it for the first one so I'm just switching up alignments really and this creates dynamism in the composition and makes it less boring honestly because if everything is aligned to the same Edge it just becomes boring and the visual journey is very dull number nine try new layouts commit to stop doing cookie cutter layers on each project you should be trying new things okay if you do this consistently project after project and you push the boundaries of what you can do I promise you 10 years from now you're not gonna be the same designer as you are today now if you're if you just keep doing the same layouts because that's where you're comfortable right then you're not gonna grow so dare
